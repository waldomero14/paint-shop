# Paint Shop Problem

## Installation
The program is written in PHP, so you need to have PHP and composer installed in your system.

You must run `composer install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## How to use

The command is called mixcolor and receives a parameter with the file input path, for instance:

```php console.php mixcolor examples/example4```

In the `examples` directory you can find some examples.
